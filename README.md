# Seminar-Paper-ML

Data and Python code used in the seminar paper "Machine learning and AI methods in physics and material science". The Data, code for the Ada-Boost-Regression and feature selection was originally from a paper "Brittle and ductile characteristics of intermetallic compounds in magnesium alloys: A large-scale screening guided by machine learning" by R. Jaafreh et al. (https://github.com/russlanj/Ductile-Brittle-Mg-Alloys-Data/blob/main/ML%20Code.py).
